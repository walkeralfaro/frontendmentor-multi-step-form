## My process

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Typescript
- Shadcn
- TailwindCSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I Learned

- **Custom Fonts with Tailwind & Shadcn:**  
  Learned how to configure and apply custom fonts in the latest versions of Tailwind and Shadcn using CSS variables:

  ```css
  :root {
    --font-sans: 'Ubuntu', sans-serif;
  }

- **Efficient Use of React Hook Form:**
  Gained a deeper understanding of `react-hook-form`, including its methods, utilities, and the global context feature that enables sharing form state across multiple components or pages.

- **Advanced Styling with Shadcn & Tailwind:**
  Improved my knowledge of Shadcn and Tailwind to style components effectively and maintain a consistent design system throughout the project.
